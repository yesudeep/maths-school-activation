# The original source code for some of these routines was written in Pascal
# in 2005 and in 2009 translated to Python by another developer before we touched it.
# We did not receive any source location information from the client or the previous
# developer about where to locate this code in the actual software, but after
# some hunting we nailed it down to the `Source Dec08/m2/Source/ActUnit.pas' file.
# All the source files with the same name in multiple project source directories
# seem to be the same so it appears these projects use the same activation procedure.
#
# Most of the original code is badly written and does not contain any form of 
# commentary.  As a result deciphering the meanings takes more time than usual.
