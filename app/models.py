        ALL the existing customer-selectable products.

        If you have 6 products and 3 subscription periods, the number
        of subscriptions will be 6 * 3 = 18.  If you add another subscription
        period, you will need to add subscriptions with that period for each
        of those 6 products.  So, 6 * 4 = 24 subscriptions must exist.
